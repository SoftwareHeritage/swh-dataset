luigi != 3.5.2, < 3.7.0 # 3.5.2 is buggy: https://github.com/spotify/luigi/issues/3312 . 3.7.0 to 3.7.2 are buggy: https://github.com/spotify/luigi/issues/3376 and https://github.com/spotify/luigi/issues/3382 . And we can't make mypy pass for both <3.7.0 and >= 3.7.3, and 3.7.x does not support Python 3.13 (https://github.com/spotify/luigi/issues/3390) so we stick to <3.7.0 for now.

# the constraint on types-requests is for python 3.7(+?), otherwise the pip
# install process takes ages (because there are gazillions of versions of
# boto/botocore and it takes ages for pip to find a compatible one).
# See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/stubs/requests/METADATA.toml
# It's not needed in the main requirement, but keeping it in -tests.txt would
# break dependencies of swh.export (not depending on swh.export[testing]).
